### Auth0 account
```
AUTH0_DOMAIN = 'sohaib-fsnd.us.auth0.com'
ALGORITHMS = ['RS256']
API_AUDIENCE = 'coffee'
```

> :warning: I DID updated the POSTman collection with both `barista` and `manager` accounts, the thing is that the token does expire, so I've created two dummy accounts on my Auth0 profile, both of them are verified and functional.

#### Manager account
